# Fabushi Governance — Agent Instructions

These instructions apply repository-wide to AI-assisted development in `bhrumom/fabushi-governance`.

## CRITICAL: Repository ownership

This repository is the canonical source for **Fabushi portfolio, migration, repository-governance and cross-repository control-plane records**.

- Product implementation belongs in its canonical product repository, not here.
- `bhrumom/fabushi` is the legacy migration/source-history repository; this governance repository owns the separated governance control-plane copy.
- Before editing, verify whether the task is governance/migration control-plane work or a product task that must be routed elsewhere.

## CRITICAL: Spec-first development — No Spec, No Code

Before changing governance automation, workflows, schemas, policies, migration tooling, repository controls, or other behavior-affecting files:

1. Read this root `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read the applicable durable Spec/project/source-of-truth and task records.
3. Check `docs/specs/`.
4. Reconcile the Spec with the latest explicit user requirement and live GitHub facts.
5. If no usable Spec exists, or it is stale/unclear/contradictory, create or repair it first with `docs/specs/SPEC_TEMPLATE.md`.

Read-only investigation needed to understand the current state or write the Spec is allowed before the Spec is complete. Implementation is not.

Mandatory lifecycle: **Discover → Spec → Architecture/Plan → Implement → Verify → Spec Compliance Review → Integrate/Deliver**.

Before completion, map each requirement/acceptance criterion to `passed`, `blocked`, or `not-applicable` with evidence/reason.

Canonical Spec-first policy: `docs/specs/spec-first-ai-development.md`.

## Migrated legacy governance instructions

The following migrated instructions remain applicable only where they do not conflict with the repository-ownership and Spec-first rules above.

This file is the repository-wide entrypoint. The complete pre-2026-09-16 repository instructions are preserved verbatim in `AGENTS.legacy.md` and remain mandatory except where this file explicitly supersedes a conflicting release/test rule. Project-first governance, Project IDs, project records, protected-main/PR governance, open-source-first research, local-disk safety, security, evidence integrity, and all unrelated product-specific instructions continue to apply.

For CI/CD and release work, the latest persisted requirement in `projects/fabushi-cicd-merge-governance/SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md` and its latest dated source takes precedence over conflicting legacy E2E/release text. As of 2026-09-18, `projects/fabushi-cicd-merge-governance/source/2026-09-18-user-directed-test-and-release-authority.md` is the controlling test/release sequencing requirement.

## CRITICAL: User-directed release and testing policy

1. **Behavioral/product testing is not a default release gate.** Do not require Fabushi official MCP, E2E, smoke, regression, simulator/emulator, packaged-app journeys, or any equivalent behavioral test merely because a build is a test, beta, prerelease, formal, or stable release.
2. **Run behavioral tests only when the user explicitly asks to test.** Do not infer a test requirement from historical project records, an older release policy, prior acceptance evidence, or agent preference. If the user requests a specific test scope, run that requested scope unless the user explicitly expands it.
3. **Fabushi official MCP is optional unless explicitly requested by the user.** It may be used as a test/control surface when the user asks for MCP-based testing, but missing MCP connectivity or missing App-owned devices is not a release blocker when MCP testing was not requested.
4. **Explicit user publication authorization controls the behavioral gate.** If the user says `发布`, `可以发布`, or gives equivalent authorization for the current candidate, proceed with publication without inventing an additional MCP/E2E/behavioral-test prerequisite.
5. **Latest explicit user instruction wins on test/release sequencing.** A newer user instruction supersedes conflicting older repository text that made testing mandatory. Do not continue enforcing a historical MCP/E2E gate after the user has waived it.
6. **Automatic E2E and other long-running behavioral test workflows remain disabled by default.** Do not trigger them automatically from PR, merge-group, push, `main`, `workflow_run`, schedule, or release events unless a later explicit user instruction enables that exact test behavior.
7. **Do not silently substitute another behavioral test.** If MCP testing was not requested, do not replace it with autonomous E2E, smoke, regression, or another product-behavior suite.
8. **Release-construction and integrity checks are distinct from behavioral testing.** Source identity, version monotonicity where required by a channel, build/sign/package steps, notarization, provenance, artifact integrity, protected-branch rules, credentials/permissions, security controls, and store/platform acceptance requirements remain applicable because they construct or authorize the release rather than test product behavior.
9. **Evidence must be truthful.** When publishing without behavioral testing, record that no behavioral test was requested/run rather than implying a pass. When testing is explicitly requested, retain the relevant exact-source/run/device/test evidence appropriate to that requested scope.
10. **No local builds/tests.** The ordinary-device disk-safety rule remains in force. Build/package on GitHub Actions or another explicitly designated disposable build runner. If the user explicitly requests behavioral testing, execute it only on an appropriate allowed test surface; do not create heavy build/test caches on persistent ordinary devices.

## CRITICAL: Ordinary devices are control/edit surfaces, never build surfaces

1. **Never compile, build, package, or run build-producing tests on an ordinary/persistent device.** An ordinary device is any long-lived developer workstation, personal Mac/Windows computer, VPS/server, production/service host, MCP host, or other machine not explicitly provisioned as a disposable build runner. This explicitly includes persistent hosts such as `bhrum2`.
2. **Disk-consuming toolchains belong only on GitHub Actions or an explicitly designated disposable build runner.** Do not run `cargo build/check/test`, Gradle/Android builds, Xcode builds, `npm`/`pnpm`/`yarn` build/test flows, Electron packaging, Docker image builds, browser/E2E dependency installs, native packaging, or equivalent compiler/package pipelines on ordinary devices.
3. **Do not populate large build/dependency caches on ordinary devices.** Do not create or warm large `target/`, `node_modules/`, Gradle, DerivedData, emulator/simulator, Playwright/browser, Docker-build, package-manager, compiler, or duplicated full-worktree caches merely to validate or build a change. Do not install/download large build dependencies there when the same work can run on Actions.
4. **Allowed ordinary-device work is low-footprint control-plane work only.** Source inspection, `git fetch/show/status/diff`, small text edits, GitHub/API orchestration, reading logs, service health checks/restarts, and deploying already-built bounded artifacts are allowed. Small static/text/config checks such as `git diff --check` are allowed only when they do not compile code, install dependencies, or materially grow disk usage.
5. **If compilation or artifact construction is required, dispatch it to Actions instead of making space locally.** Low disk space is a stop signal, not a reason to delete files and then continue a local build. Cleaning a persistent host may restore service health, but must not be followed by build/cache recreation on that host.
6. **Persistent-host deployments must remain bounded and rollback-safe.** Reuse already-built immutable artifacts, inspect free space before staging material artifacts, avoid duplicate copies when possible, and remove superseded temporary/staging data after successful atomic activation. Never sacrifice service/database/source data to make room for a build.
7. **No implicit exception.** A local/persistent build is allowed only when the user explicitly designates that specific machine as a disposable build runner for that task. Otherwise fail closed and move the build to GitHub Actions.

## CRITICAL: Completion semantics for release work

For application-affecting tasks, merge and canonical-main readback remain required when the task calls for a repository merge. Publication completion follows the user's explicit instruction: when the user authorizes publication, the release may proceed once the required non-behavioral release-construction/platform constraints are satisfied. Behavioral-test evidence is required only when the user explicitly requested behavioral testing for that candidate. Missing MCP/E2E evidence is not, by itself, a blocker unless the user asked for that test.

All non-conflicting instructions in `AGENTS.legacy.md` remain mandatory.
