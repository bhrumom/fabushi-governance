# FCM-023 — Fast test release / formal release lane split

- **Project:** FAB-P0003 / FCM
- **Status:** in-progress
- **Source:** `source/2026-09-03-fcm-023-test-formal-release-lanes.md`
- **Owner:** Fabushi engineering automation

## Objective

Remove long application-driving E2E from automatic CI/CD, split release entry points by platform, and provide explicit fast `test` versus strict `formal` release modes. Current delivery target is a macOS test build only.

## Atomic acceptance

| ID | Deliverable | Verification | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| FCM-023.1 | Stop automatic Electron packaged/real-App Playwright | workflow triggers/conditions show no automatic long E2E | implemented |
| FCM-023.2 | Stop automatic native device/simulator E2E | mobile workflow triggers/conditions show UI E2E is explicit-only | implemented |
| FCM-023.3 | Disable automatic GBF seven-gate fan-out | `gbf-release-candidate.yml` is manual-only | implemented |
| FCM-023.4 | Add separate macOS/Windows/Linux/Android/iOS release workflows | five visible manual workflow files | implemented |
| FCM-023.5 | Distinguish test/formal modes | each platform workflow exposes `release_kind`; long E2E only on formal | implemented |
| FCM-023.6 | Produce current macOS test build only | latest branch SHA produces Mac-only artifact; other platform workflows not dispatched | passed |
| FCM-023.7 | Install/launch test build on target Mac for product review | target Mac launch evidence | passed |

## Constraints

- Heavy builds/tests remain GitHub-hosted; do not build the application locally.
- Test artifacts must be clearly non-formal and must not silently become stable/latest production releases.
- Formal release still requires platform E2E and platform trust gates.
- Do not use failing/inaccurate app-driving E2E as an automatic merge/release blocker until recalibrated against a real test build.

## Implementation evidence

- Automatic Electron quality gate is reduced to deterministic architecture/main-process/TypeScript/renderer checks; no Playwright, Host build, packaging, or multi-platform matrix.
- `GBF release candidate regression`, Host E2E, macOS release E2E, Apple auto-store fan-out, and old post-main release chain are manual-only/disabled.
- Desktop releases use one reusable single-platform builder plus `Release macOS`, `Release Windows`, and `Release Linux`.
- `Release Android` and `Release iOS` are manual-only. Their formal modes fail closed until real-build E2E calibration is restored.
- YAML parse, `git diff --check`, `.github/scripts/assert-gbf-release-readiness.py`, `.github/scripts/assert-native-electron-canonical.sh`, and the FCM-023 policy smoke checks passed locally; application builds remain GitHub Actions only. The legacy unreferenced `check-publish-cd-release.sh` still has an unrelated stale account-registration text assertion and is not used as acceptance evidence for this task.

## macOS test release evidence — 2026-09-03

- Source SHA: `550f644cd6c16c729d0c956f2ecd2c81cfe8050e`.
- Mac-only workflow: `Fabushi macOS hot package`, run `33732202936`, job `100574499149`, conclusion `success`.
- Host binary cache: hit; Rust setup/build/save steps skipped.
- Renderer, offline ASR, Computer Use staging, macOS package, artifact upload, and prerelease publication: success.
- Formal-only Developer ID setup, Playwright diagnostics, Linux E2E, and macOS/Windows E2E: skipped by `release_kind=test`.
- Test release: `desktop-mac-test-152-550f644cd6c1`, version `1.2.14-test.152`.
- Assets: `fabushi-1.2.14-test.152-macos-arm64.dmg`, ZIP, blockmaps, and `latest-mac.yml`.
- Target Mac install: `/Users/gloriachan/Applications/Fabushi Test.app`; existing formal application was not overwritten.
- Target Mac launch: process `/Users/gloriachan/Applications/Fabushi Test.app/Contents/MacOS/fabushi` observed running after launch.
- Windows/Linux/Android/iOS release workflows were not dispatched for this request.

## Next action

Wait for product review of this real test build, then recalibrate the inaccurate app-driving E2E against observed behavior before enabling those checks as formal-release gates.

## Product-review finding — 2026-09-03

The first real Mac test artifact launched, but it is not yet a usable authentication/Agent test artifact. Because the `test` lane skipped the formal signing identity, the installed app and bundled `mahayana-app-host` are ad-hoc signed; macOS therefore prompts for the existing Fabushi auth Keychain item and the blocked Host channel causes `feature.*` timeouts. This means the fast lane still needs a safe Mac test-signing/keychain strategy before it can be the baseline used to recalibrate formal E2E. Long E2E remains disabled; do not work around this by granting an unsigned/ad-hoc Host permanent Keychain access.

## FCM-023.8 — signed fast Mac test artifact

- **Deliverable:** keep the fast Mac `test` lane but import/use the canonical Developer ID for the outer app and bundled executables, while continuing to skip notarization and long App E2E.
- **Acceptance:** GitHub Actions fails closed when Mac signing credentials/identity are unavailable; produced test `.app` reports canonical identifiers and Team ID, launches without the ad-hoc Host Keychain prompt, and remains a prerelease rather than stable/latest.
- **Verification:** static release-contract gate + Mac-only Actions package run + target-Mac `codesign`/Host/UI evidence.
- **Status:** in-progress.
