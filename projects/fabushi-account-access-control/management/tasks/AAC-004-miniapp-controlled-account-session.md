## Objective

Allow an already-authenticated Fabushi user to open/install/use an official Mini App without a second login while keeping the raw Fabushi access token, refresh token and provider credentials outside the Mini App/model boundary. Server/Host resolves the canonical account and exposes only the minimum app-scoped account/session projection required for runtime, sync and entitlement reads.

## Acceptance

- [ ] MCP, runtime-state, Marketplace account mutation and commerce/entitlement routes resolve one stable Fabushi user/account identity; bearer/cookie/session transport identifiers are not used as ownership namespaces.
- [ ] A valid Fabushi session automatically scopes `global-dharma` runtime and installed state to the authenticated account.
- [ ] Raw access/refresh tokens are never serialized into MCP structuredContent, Mini App runtime state, account-sync events, browser localStorage or model-visible tool arguments/results.
- [ ] Session revoke/logout causes subsequent protected Mini App runtime/commerce reads to return unauthenticated/fail closed; old account runtime cannot be read under another account.
- [ ] Public Marketplace browse remains independent of revoked/expired session, preserving AAC-003 behavior.
- [ ] Same account with different valid device/session tokens converges to the same Mini App runtime and entitlement authority; different account remains isolated.
- [ ] Contract/integration tests cover redaction, same-account convergence, cross-account isolation and revoked-session denial.
- [ ] Changes pass protected PR gates and exact canonical-main readback before this task can be completed.

## Reuse / non-goals

- Reuse canonical Fabushi auth and `/api/auth/user-info`/`resolveUser` identity boundary; do not add Auth.js/Better Auth or a parallel auth database.
- Reuse AAC-003 terminal-session cleanup and public Marketplace decoupling.
- Do not expose raw auth material to Mini App JavaScript as a convenience token.
- Do not mark entitlement from a client purchase flag; server-side canonical entitlement read remains authoritative.

## Evidence

- Intake/audit source: `projects/telegram-fabushi-integration/source/2026-09-06-global-dharma-web-service-sync-commerce.md` at commit `2eb4b0cf524942f003bc6ec973ba8119745b2030`.
- Implementation commit: `f9a2df5850e81bd5f1fbe3450adf4ec4e3b0f906`; protected PR/CI and packaged Host credential-bootstrap evidence remain pending.

## 2026-09-07 Host-controlled credential closure

- Open-source-first review: reuse Keycloak-style audience/scope downscoping semantics (Keycloak, Apache-2.0) and OAuth 2.0 token revocation semantics from RFC 7009; no new auth framework or dependency is introduced.
- Canonical Platform Worker remains the only delegated credential issuer. The five-minute RS256 Mini App token is bound to parent Fabushi session sid, target plugin:<id>, exact miniapp:<id> scope and Host device id.
- Issuance re-checks that the parent Fabushi session is active. Protected plugin validation re-checks account_sessions.revoked_at/expires_at on every introspection/entitlement read, so logout/revoke invalidates an otherwise unexpired delegated token.
- POST /v1/auth/plugin-token/introspect returns only the stable account id needed by Web/service runtime projection. It never returns the delegated token, access token, refresh token or provider credential.
- The delegated token is accepted only by the matching plugin identity introspection and canonical entitlement read. Wallet, purchase, restore, developer and admin routes continue to require the Host's normal authenticated platform request.
- Packaged desktop/mobile proof, protected merge, exact-main readback and post-main video evidence remain required before AAC-004 can be marked complete.
