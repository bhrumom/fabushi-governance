# TFI-M9-GLOBAL-DHARMA-IOS-001 — iOS Global Dharma Mini App / Bot / StoreKit closure

- Project: `FAB-P0001 / TFI`
- Cross-project boundary: `FAB-P0008 / AAC`
- Parent: `M9-GLOBAL-DHARMA-003`
- Baseline canonical main: `55a7e167b728ebc6aa43e1523cc2de520f622e9b` (2026-09-17 governed resync after #2297/#2299/#2316 landed; previous governed head `79cb7e507b5a2076a9f60869d3425897ca0063f5`)
- Branch: `feat/tfi-ios-global-dharma-commerce-20260906`
- State: `IMPLEMENTING / PR_ACTIVE`
- Owner: iOS / Mini App Host / payments
- Open-source decision: `../../source/2026-09-06-ios-global-dharma-storekit-webmcp-open-source-first.md`


## 2026-09-17 governed resynchronization

- Canonical main re-read immediately before sync: `55a7e167b728ebc6aa43e1523cc2de520f622e9b`.
- Previous PR head: `79cb7e507b5a2076a9f60869d3425897ca0063f5`.
- One semantic conflict remained in `MiniAppWebMcpSurface.swift`; resolution preserves Global Dharma entitlement refresh and the newer generated-Mini-App `localHtmlOverride` hardening path.
- No local build or behavioral test was run. The resulting pushed head must obtain fresh GitHub Actions evidence; historical runs remain non-authoritative for queue entry.
- The exact resulting head is read back from GitHub PR metadata after push rather than embedded in this same commit, avoiding a self-referential SHA claim.

## Goal

Close the real iOS user journey for the official `global-dharma` Mini App without introducing a second Bot, login, WebMCP runtime, payment ledger, or entitlement state machine:

1. Marketplace search for `全球法布施` and install the real release;
2. bind local install to canonical Fabushi account sync so the real `global-dharma-bot` appears in Messages;
3. send natural-language Bot turns through the existing `chat.send(agentId:, mode: agent)` path and unified WebMCP/Mini App Host;
4. expose a Telegram-style `打开应用` action that opens the installed Mini App from the same Host/runtime;
5. reuse the existing Fabushi login session without exposing bearer/refresh credentials to Mini App JavaScript;
6. offer server-authoritative CNY 1080 lifetime purchase of `local.prayer-wheel.start` through Apple Advanced Commerce / StoreKit 2;
7. restore purchases explicitly and trust only canonical server entitlement `access.allowed`;
8. validate on a packaged/installable exact-main iOS build through GitHub Actions and the App-owned semantic device.

## Atomic implementation

### A — Marketplace → account install → Bot

- [x] Keep local package install in `feature.plugin.install`.
- [x] Add canonical Host action `feature.marketplace.add`, backed by `mahayana-product` authenticated `POST /v1/marketplace/plugins/:plugin_id/add`.
- [x] iOS install requires `accountSynchronized=true` and a non-empty Bot id after local install; local-only install is not reported as journey success.
- [x] Keep native request/device/account platform `ios`; normalize Product API browse/list to `mobile`; for external Mini App package installation mirror the real App Host by trying native artifact first and falling back to `mobile` artifact without changing device identity.
- [ ] PR CI proves Rust + iOS build/tests.
- [ ] Packaged exact-main journey proves `全球法布施` search → install → permission approval → return → `global-dharma-bot` visible.

### B — Bot → unified WebMCP → Telegram-like Mini App

- [x] Reuse real `bot.list` discovery and `chat.send(... mode: agent)` stream; no iOS Bot implementation fork.
- [x] Convert the existing Bot desktop icon into semantic `mobile-bot-open-app` / `打开应用` for Global Dharma only.
- [x] `打开应用` first verifies `feature.plugin.active(global-dharma)` and opens `MiniAppWebMcpSurface` backed by the same `MarketplaceModel` / `MahayanaHost`.
- [x] Preserve local Mini App `runtime.call` WebMCP bridge and native approval policy.
- [x] Expose existing Grok-shell back navigation to the six semantic tools so the same user journey can return from Marketplace to Messages.
- [ ] Packaged exact-main journey proves natural-language Bot execution and same-runtime Mini App state at meaningful checkpoints.

### C — Fabushi account boundary (AAC cross-acceptance)

- [x] Reuse current signed-in account through trusted `feature.auth.deviceAgentSession` only in the native app.
- [x] Never inject account bearer/refresh credentials into WKWebView or Mini App JavaScript.
- [x] Account-level Marketplace install is authenticated through canonical `mahayana-product`, not a Swift-only duplicate API client.
- [x] Payment/restore never writes entitlement locally; TFI Fabushi Pay remains the only payment/entitlement authority.
- [ ] Packaged exact-main journey proves no second login is requested after the Fabushi test account session is established.

### D — CNY 1080 lifetime Advanced Commerce

Canonical identifiers are not interchangeable:

- product id: `prod.global-dharma.local-prayer-wheel.lifetime`
- payment SKU: `local-prayer-wheel.lifetime`
- capability: `local.prayer-wheel.start`
- product kind: `digital_durable`
- currency/amount: `CNY / 108000` minor units = `¥1080`

Implementation:

- [x] Read canonical entitlement + `purchaseOptions` and fail closed on SKU/product/currency/amount/product-kind mismatch.
- [x] Enable Apple purchase only when server advertises active rail `apple_in_app_purchase`.
- [x] Create canonical Payment Intent with a fresh idempotency key and server-owned price.
- [x] Require checkout `appleInAppPurchase`, canonical verify path, and Advanced Commerce signing path.
- [x] Read current StoreKit storefront immediately before signing; send the three-letter country code to the server.
- [x] Consume server JWS as StoreKit `advancedCommerceData`; the signed request already carries `paymentId` as `requestInfo.appAccountToken`.
- [x] Verify the resulting StoreKit transaction locally, require its `appAccountToken == paymentId`, re-verify with Fabushi Pay, and call `finish()` only after server success.
- [x] Refresh canonical entitlement and expose the prayer-wheel access as allowed only when `access.allowed == true`.
- [ ] Sandbox completes a real Advanced Commerce charge and entitlement grant.

### E — Restore

- [x] Restore is explicit/user-initiated and calls `AppStore.sync()`.
- [x] Iterate only verified current entitlements; recover original Fabushi `paymentId` from `appAccountToken`.
- [x] Re-verify candidate transactions with Fabushi Pay under the current Fabushi account and require the exact lifetime SKU.
- [x] Refresh canonical entitlement and refuse to unlock on StoreKit state alone.
- [ ] Sandbox proves purchase on one install/device context and restore into the same Fabushi account on a clean/reinstalled context.

## Automated verification before merge

- `GlobalDharmaCommerceTests`:
  - exact canonical CNY 1080 durable offer accepted;
  - tampered price/SKU rejected;
  - pending Apple provider keeps purchase disabled;
  - Advanced Commerce `signatureInfo.token` envelope exact;
  - empty JWS rejected.
- Existing Rust/JS account sync tests remain authoritative for `miniapp.installed → bot.added`, message history, cloud/content state and account isolation.
- Test-driver contract keeps request/device/account `platform=ios`, maps Marketplace API browse/list to server `mobile`, and mirrors the production App Host native→`mobile` artifact fallback. `InstalledPluginPointer` records plugin/version/artifact/runtime/path and has no platform identity field.
- No local `xcodebuild`. All iOS compilation/tests occur in GitHub Actions.

## Post-main packaged acceptance

Only canonical main may satisfy this section. Required evidence from `ios-interactive-app-e2e.yml` or a narrower equivalent that preserves the same gates:

- packaged/installable `.app` built for exact accepted main SHA;
- recording begins before install;
- app logs in with protected CI test credential, then the App itself registers a new App-owned iOS device;
- all six `fabushi.app.status/snapshot/find/action/wait/assert` tools used;
- one screenshot after each meaningful checkpoint;
- complete uncut operation video;
- `.xcresult`, semantic trace, app/runner logs and report uploaded with `if: always()`;
- evidence must identify exact run/job/SHA and remain downloadable.

Journey checkpoints:

1. logged-in Messages home / no second login;
2. enter Marketplace;
3. search `全球法布施`;
4. result `global-dharma` visible;
5. install + approve declared permissions;
6. account sync confirmed and return to Messages;
7. `global-dharma-bot` visible;
8. open Bot and send natural language status/start request;
9. observe Bot stream / WebMCP agent step;
10. invoke `打开应用`;
11. same Global Dharma Mini App/runtime visible and state consistent with Bot operation;
12. entitlement status visible;
13. CI/Simulator test-mode: canonical ledger buy `¥1080` with no StoreKit and no real charge → canonical entitlement allowed → prayer-wheel action allowed; production Apple validation remains a separate Advanced Commerce sandbox gate;
14. CI/Simulator test-mode restore through canonical `/v1/purchases/restore`; production restore remains `AppStore.sync()` + verified transaction + Pay reverify; re-check canonical entitlement in both modes;
15. close Mini App and finish semantic session cleanly.

## Production Apple external blockers — fail closed

The repository cannot fabricate any of the following. If absent at post-main time, payment acceptance remains `BLOCKED`, not `PASS`:

1. Apple has approved Advanced Commerce API access for the Fabushi app / applicable Mini Apps Partner Program use case.
2. App Store Connect contains the appropriate one-time generic product id for the Mini Apps Partner Program and it has been submitted to Apple per Advanced Commerce setup.
3. Canonical `payment_provider_bindings` for this product has provider `apple_advanced_commerce`, a real generic provider product reference, and `sync_state='active'`.
4. The Global Dharma catalog has an explicitly approved Apple `tax_code`; the original seed leaves it `NULL`, and repository code must not guess tax classification.
5. Deployed Commerce/Pay environments have `APPLE_ADVANCED_COMMERCE_ENABLED` and real `APPLE_IAP_ISSUER_ID`, `APPLE_IAP_KEY_ID`, `APPLE_IAP_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM`, `APPLE_BUNDLE_ID`, plus App Store Server verification credentials.
6. A signed eligible iOS build plus Sandbox Apple Account/device is available.

Apple explicitly states Advanced Commerce purchases cannot use StoreKit Testing in Xcode. Therefore local `.storekit` simulation is not accepted as production Apple evidence. The governed GitHub Actions Simulator test-mode is different: it is allowed to exercise the canonical Fabushi purchase ledger only, must never invoke StoreKit or create a real charge, and still must re-read canonical server entitlement before unlocking the capability.

- Full Host/Product/WebMCP/FFI PR validation at head `34ac2618e7e5f268485573c94085a9ddfbc13b4e`: Mahayana fast `34039127343` success; Vendor Isolation `34039127324` success; Native mobile fast gate `34039127357` success; CI `34039127390` success; Project portfolio governance `34039127412` success; GBF security `34039127371` success; Electron desktop quality `34039127425` success; Computer control security `34039127321` success.
- Marketplace Contract run `34039127475` exposed a real live iOS discovery defect in `Test Mahayana marketplace packages`: request/device `platform=ios` was passed directly to the Product API, which accepts only `cli|desktop|mobile|web`, producing HTTP 400 `invalid_marketplace_platform`. Diagnostic artifact `mahayana-marketplace-validation-diagnostics` id `9991275111`, digest `sha256:f86763ee928dea7b74a0bc0c15429cea78e088ed836df1c885c154c1f7ddfd05`.
- Fix commit `dd8520a49b00fcbdd8c468bce25577085ac99f8b`: normalize Marketplace API browse/list native platforms (`ios|android → mobile`) while preserving native request/device semantics; mapper unit test added. Subsequent live validation proved the test-driver also had to mirror the already-existing App Host native→`mobile` artifact fallback for universal Mini App packages.
- Alignment merge commit: `9d51e3e3d514cfcc2b6337e1baaecdc51c8453d3` merges canonical `main@8595a50196309c8ebb91c3f8077125d7dc9e3ffa` into the governed iOS branch without conflicts.
- Final pre-alignment head `c0c050b6120e744849a71d1df3fe05ec372413b6` had four failing checks — Mahayana iOS test-driver contract `34039955034`, Global Dharma Rust `34039955089`, Plugin Marketplace Contract `34039955156`, Mahayana fast checks `34039955007` — all blocked at the same `backend.rs` rustfmt delta before substantive test execution.
- GitHub Actions supplied the exact rustfmt correction for `backend.rs`; this round applies only that emitted formatting delta and delegates authoritative `cargo fmt --check` to Actions because the local Mac has no Rust toolchain.
- CI/Simulator payment acceptance is now explicitly canonical-ledger-only/no-charge; production Apple Advanced Commerce remains separately fail-closed on real Apple eligibility/configuration.
- Final-head PR CI / merge-queue / accepted-main SHA / post-main iOS build / packaged journey / video / screenshots / `.xcresult` / trace/logs/report: pending; only real GitHub identifiers may satisfy them.

- Current-head Marketplace Contract run `34048201512` reached the live package test after rustfmt/Worker checks passed, then failed `live_official_global_dharma_is_external_verified_and_persistent` because the test-driver called `PluginInstaller.install(..., "ios")` directly and returned `no compatible artifact for platform ios`. Diagnostic artifact `9993892782`, digest `sha256:457de7cee04532c9fc561244f70989f5fc9245da45401f69e69842650802d52b`.
- Live official `global-dharma@1.0.0` metadata advertises one verified `local-web` artifact `global-dharma-universal-ui` for `desktop|mobile|web|cli`. The real App Host already retries `mobile` when native `ios|android` installation fails, so this is a test-driver parity defect rather than an iOS product-install defect.
- Follow-up keeps `platform=ios` for request/device/account semantics and adds the same native→`mobile` artifact fallback to the test-driver; authoritative proof must come from the next GitHub Actions Marketplace Contract run.

- Current-head Marketplace Contract run `34048908027` proved the native→`mobile` artifact fallback works: the previous `no compatible artifact for platform ios` error disappeared and the focused fallback unit test passed. The remaining failure was a stale live-test assertion at `test_driver_backend.rs:111` expecting `receipt.platform == "ios"`; actual value is `Null` because `InstalledPluginPointer` intentionally has no platform field. The install response already preserves native request/device semantics as top-level `platform: "ios"`, while the selected official artifact correctly declares `mobile`. Diagnostic artifact `9994122473`, digest `sha256:2a9d801c476cf5fcc6dae44c373cc13ec8b2dbf62cbecf7a639a3f4b96adbc8d`.
- Follow-up corrects only the live-test contract: assert top-level native `platform == "ios"` and assert the selected release artifact supports `mobile`; do not invent a platform field in the persisted receipt. Authoritative verification remains the next GitHub Actions Marketplace Contract run.

- Marketplace Contract run `34049664397` on head `084b7d794bffed34cbc300b6d6465ebd3cd573c9` proved both prior fixes: native→`mobile` fallback unit test passed, and the live test advanced past native-platform/universal-artifact assertions. It then failed only at stale receipt field access `receipt["sha256"]`; canonical `InstalledPluginPointer` serializes `artifactId` + `artifactSha256` and intentionally does not persist `sourceUrl`. Diagnostic artifact `9994229393`, digest `sha256:24ef6fb9b2fb76c6c1f739e12d07cda92ec02994adecec61b8ff58ebcf28a6d8`.
- Follow-up aligns the entire live persistence contract in one pass: installation, post-install list and restart list compare canonical `artifactId`, `artifactSha256`, `version` and `runtime`; release-manifest artifact matching uses `id/runtime/sha256`; external provenance remains verified through `marketplaceSource`, release manifest and the selected artifact instead of inventing a persisted `sourceUrl`.

- Canonical main advanced during PR validation to `c82b29cd6404c2f19b93d8479b2e2cae45469249` via #2445 (`feat(TFI): unify Global Dharma WebMCP runtime and commerce authority`). #2446 was re-aligned rather than validating against stale `8595a501…`; the merge introduces the canonical shared Bot/Web runtime, delegated session-bound Mini App identity, and server commerce authority required by this iOS journey. Canonical AAC task `AAC-004` is owned by that controlled account-session work; the iOS commerce boundary is therefore allocated as `AAC-005` / `AAC-R015`.

- Re-aligned current head `36024463982d8c45604fd61275e9f2f1c1e099d9` triggered iOS test-driver run `34050259724`; it stopped only at rustfmt before protocol/live execution. Actions emitted two exact multiline `assert_eq!` formatting changes in `test_driver_backend.rs`; evidence artifact `9994335885`, digest `sha256:44c4f870d2b7ae20c353f315dc0b68384cde58faa00677688b25c6b5a2a84d72`. This follow-up applies only that formatter output; no receipt/runtime semantics change.

## 2026-09-07 — exact-main e926e02e re-alignment and current failure closure

- Canonical `main` advanced again to `e926e02e94fc2408738ce7ec678f2267baa4a0e1` via #2454 while #2446 was still open. Governed alignment merge `395fc59b5de3941892e2c3e45757987e58e84633` has parents `caeba22206fc405f174691763f9be2ba470329c2` and `e926e02e94fc2408738ce7ec678f2267baa4a0e1`; product-code merges were conflict-free and append-only TFI/AAC governance histories were preserved from both sides.
- Marketplace Contract `34050415486`, job `101532905722`, advanced through rustfmt/Worker and all earlier iOS artifact/receipt fixes, then failed only because the live test still asserted deprecated `marketplaceSource.marketplaceHostsPackage == false`; the current canonical source projection returns no such field (`Null`) while `sourceRef` and `repository` remain the verified provenance contract. Diagnostic artifact `9994523246`, digest `sha256:2b6f4c987de8506f80abd744822a44ae2b1596bb8c54bac5f7a2e74195de6b57`.
- Native mobile `34050415248`, job `101532904942`, failed its PR whitespace fast gate only at `projects/telegram-fabushi-integration/management/wbs/M9.md:149` due to one extra blank line at EOF; no mobile build/test step executed after that fail-closed gate.
- Follow-up removes only the obsolete Marketplace source-field assertion and normalizes the M9 EOF to one newline. Canonical source provenance continues to be checked by non-empty `sourceRef`/`repository` plus release-manifest/artifact integrity. No runtime/auth/commerce behavior is changed.
- No local Rust/Swift/Android build or test is used. New current-head GitHub Actions are authoritative. Protected merge, accepted-main SHA, installable iOS package, App-owned Simulator journey, complete video, step screenshots, `.xcresult`, trace/report/logs remain `PENDING` until actually produced.

## 2026-09-07 — canonical drift to 8adfa009

- While exact-head CI for `e980cf93dd16ae0a31d04e01afd626fd6717161e` was running, protected main advanced through #2455 to `8adfa009f2fdf349e9f0c659fcfa4176ff7d7c2c` (`test(TFI): record Global Dharma restart and logout journey`).
- #2446 immediately re-aligned with a no-conflict merge; #2455 contributes only `desktop/e2e/miniapp-bot-parity.spec.ts` changes to this branch and does not alter the iOS runtime/commerce implementation.
- Previous e980 CI is retained as historical evidence only. Authoritative merge eligibility moves to the new head/base pair; exact-main iOS package/video remains `PENDING`.

## 2026-09-07 — current Marketplace source projection correction

- Exact-head Marketplace Contract `34053892448`, cloud job `101542174216`, passed rustfmt, platform Worker, all focused unit tests, the iOS native→`mobile` fallback, canonical receipt fields and release-manifest identity, then failed only at `test_driver_backend.rs:141` because the live test still expected obsolete `marketplaceSource.sourceRef`; current value is `Null`.
- Canonical Worker serialization returns `source_json` verbatim. The official `global-dharma@1.0.0` source contract is `provider: fabushi-official`, GitHub `repository` URL and a 40-hex `commit`; it does not define `sourceRef`. Diagnostic artifact `9995497157`, digest `sha256:3e7ea09afb9c521764f21f8f39695e47d087bbb62515eff7af5a63935f938348`.
- Follow-up replaces only the stale `sourceRef` assertion with exact official-provider validation, GitHub repository URL validation and 40-hex source commit validation. External release protocol/plugin/version plus selected artifact id/runtime/SHA/platform integrity checks remain unchanged. No runtime/auth/commerce behavior changes; no local build/test is used. New GitHub Actions are authoritative; protected merge and packaged iOS evidence remain `PENDING`.

## 2026-09-07 — Actions-emitted provenance rustfmt baseline

- Head `ec05e7e36882173a9e96c464f48870c1ae5892b1` Mahayana fast `34054520721`, job `101543811294`, failed before substantive tests only at `cargo fmt --all -- --check`. Actions emitted one exact delta at `test_driver_backend.rs:151`, expanding the source-commit hexadecimal assertion across rustfmt lines.
- This follow-up applies only that emitted formatting delta. No local `cargo fmt`, Rust build/test or iOS build/test is run; the next current-head Actions remain authoritative.

## 2026-09-07 — canonical route repair baseline 43ce998f

- Head `7f9511621bd6ceb2f333fc19ec465a33044bd7b2` completed the full task-specific PR gate set on the then-current `main@8adfa009…`: Marketplace Contract `34054593453` / cloud job `101544034838` was fully green including Worker deploy, live browse/download/install, Mini App run, revoke rejection and evidence; iOS driver `34054593251`, Native `34054593248`, Mahayana fast `34054593237`, Global Dharma Rust `34054593261`, Web Service `34054593253` and required CI `34054593269` were also green. Marketplace artifacts: `9995817557` (`sha256:afbd15493dde79a6827171d973d0b23bd99d12ffec8805c8280603f7256ea693`) and diagnostics `9995765469` (`sha256:c598e6a0caf3232c39b36edbc7886532cd9eebbf73637d2c65b0967638fd8f3f`).
- Before queue entry, protected main advanced through #2456/#2458/#2459 to `43ce998fd5fbcae032c179a8814de9ec08d03f4c`, adding the canonical installed-Mini-App `/route` projection and related product/worker tests. Because this directly affects Bot→WebMCP command routing, the old green set is historical evidence only and cannot authorize merge.
- Governed alignment merge `4fd797fe76353ea9876c89d1a3d9641d4e65bed1` has parents `7f9511621bd6ceb2f333fc19ec465a33044bd7b2` and `43ce998fd5fbcae032c179a8814de9ec08d03f4c`; product-code integration was conflict-free, and only append-only TFI governance records required preserving both histories.
- New-head GitHub Actions are required again. Protected merge, exact-main installable iOS package, fresh App-owned Simulator journey, complete video, step screenshots, `.xcresult`, trace/report/logs remain `PENDING`.

## 2026-09-07 — canonical drift to a19e17b5 and iOS shell conflict closure

- Live canonical `main` advanced to `a19e17b5b15ecff5f4a408d58f8e72edae33fd47` while #2446 remained open; the branch was `behind 11 / ahead 24` and GitHub reported `mergeable=false`, `mergeable_state=dirty`.
- Controlled merge diagnosis found exactly one content conflict: `mobile/ios/Fabushi/GrokMobileShell.swift`. The Global Dharma branch needs `ContentView(..., onShellBack:)` so the semantic six-tool surface can return from Marketplace, while accepted main replaced the legacy `ZStack` back-button overlay with a non-overlapping `VStack` header after real iOS AX close-control failures.
- Resolution preserves both invariants: the accepted main `VStack` header remains, and the nested `ContentView` still receives `onShellBack: { legacyOpen = false }`; no Bot/WebMCP/account/commerce behavior is weakened.
- No local build/test is run or counted. Only `git diff --check` is used locally; authoritative Swift/Rust/Marketplace/CI validation must come from the new GitHub Actions head.
- Live `fabushi test` account discovery is independently blocked before device enumeration by HTTP 400 / `We couldn't connect your account`; no runner-owned gateway, Extension, old device, or preinstalled environment is accepted as a substitute. Packaged App-owned iOS journey, continuous video, screenshots, `.xcresult`, semantic trace, logs/report and downloadable evidence remain `PENDING` until the connector and exact-main run provide them.
